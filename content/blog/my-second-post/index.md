Hey there!  

My twin sister and I founded a hack club(programming club) at our highschool with the main aim to bring the same enthusiasm as we see tech to our classmates and learn as a team about technologies and team work.
You can found more info about it on our website : https://hackclubmalagon.netlify.app ðŸ”—
There you can find out what we did in the sessions and also some of the projects we made!
