Hi there! My name's Olga Nedelcu and I’m an 18-year-old high school senior from  Castilla la Mancha,Spain. I write code, run a Hack Club at my high school, and love techie things.

‍I’m passionate about bringing tech opportunities to people who don’t have them, particularly to students in small towns and with problems finding the right tools.From my personal life to the Hack Club I lead at my school,I try to make an impact with everything I do.

> A salted duck egg is a Chinese preserved food product made by soaking duck
> eggs in brine, or packing each egg in damp, salted charcoal. In Asian
> supermarkets, these eggs are sometimes sold covered in a thick layer of salted
> charcoal paste. The eggs may also be sold with the salted paste removed,
> wrapped in plastic, and vacuum packed. From the salt curing process, the
> salted duck eggs have a briny aroma, a gelatin-like egg white and a
> firm-textured, round yolk that is bright orange-red in color.
