Hi there! My name's Olga Nedelcu and I’m an 18-year-old high school senior from  Castilla la Mancha,Spain. I write code, run a Hack Club at my high school, and love techie things.

‍I’m passionate about bringing tech opportunities to people who don’t have them, particularly to students in small towns and with problems finding the right tools.From my personal life to the Hack Club I lead at my school,I try to make an impact with everything I do.
